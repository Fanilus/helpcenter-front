strategies tailored to\n                the needs of a broad range of non-professional users, thereby\n                making the management of crypto assets more efficient and\n                accessible. DSSP operates atop decentralized options liquidity\n                markets as an additional layer, offering user-friendly tools for\n                individuals seeking low to moderate risks to enhance the\n                profitability of their crypto asset holdings.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                Similar to how Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Decentralized\n                Exchanges (DEXes) have disrupted traditional exchanges and\n                market makers, Tymio DSPP aims to do the same for banks by\n                democratizing the creation of customized structured products.\n                DSPP enables users to tailor their own financial products\n                according to their needs, removing the reliance on traditional\n                banking institutions. This shift towards decentralization allows\n                for greater accessibility, transparency, and control over\n                investment strategies, putting the power in the hands of\n                individual users.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n            </Styled.Description>\n          </Styled.Content>\n        </Styled.Container>\n        <Styled.Container>\n          <Styled.Content>\n            <Styled.Title>\n              <Styled.ListItem>\n                <UI.H2>2.</UI.H2>\n                <UI.H2>Market</UI.H2>\n              </Styled.ListItem>\n            </Styled.Title>\n            <Styled.Description>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                Bitcoin revolutionized finance by enabling trustless financial\n                transactions. Ethereum took it a step further, allowing smart\n                contracts and complex financial products, thus initiating\n                decentralized finance (DeFi). However, the complexity of these\n                products has limited their use to a relatively small group of\n                people who understand blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                Structured products are well-known in traditional fiat finance,\n                typically offered by banks to high net worth individuals (HNWI)\n                as pre-packaged, out-of-the-box products. According to\n                Bloomberg, the total structured product market accounts for over\n                $7 trillion in invested assets*. We expect several trends to\n                continue over time, such as overall financial literacy growth\n                and increasing crypto/DeFi adoption worldwide.

In the first case\n                (https://sell-high.io), you have an ETH and are willing to sell\n                it above the market value or just generate yield. So, you set a\n                time limit order to sell ETH. For example, the current ETH price\n                is 1200, and you are ready to sell it for 1350. You enter the\n                total number of ETH, set the price at 1350, and then browse the\n                contract duration options. Typically, the duration might be a\n                couple of days, a week, or a month. You select an appropriate\n                contract duration and agree to the terms.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                After the specified number of days, you can have one of two\n                outcomes: If the ETH price exceeds 1350 on the day and at the\n                moment of contract expiration, it means you have sold your ETH.\n                In this case, you receive your return in USDC, equivalent to the\n                sold ETH (at 1350 each) plus the yield. If the price of one ETH\n                is lower than 1350 at the moment of contract expiration, your\n                ETH is not sold, and you receive back your ETH plus the yield.\n                As you can see, you earn a fixed yield in either case, and\n                you'll likely sell your ETH at a significantly higher price than\n                it was at the time of the transaction.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <Styled.Card>\n                <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                  <span>NOTE:</span> <br />\n                  The further the required ETH sell price is from the current\n                  market price, the lower the probability that the transaction\n                  will occur.

So, you set a\n                  time limit order to buy ETH. For example, the current ETH\n                  price is 1200, and you are prepared to buy it for 1100. You\n                  enter the total number of ETH, set the price at 1100, and then\n                  browse the contract duration options.\n                </UI.Paragraph>\n              </Styled.Card>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                Typically, the duration might be a couple of days, a week, or a\n                month.

After the specified number of days, you can\n                have one of two outcomes: If the ETH price is above 1100 on the\n                day and at the moment of contract expiration, it means you\n                haven't bought ETH. In this case, you receive your return in\n                USDC plus the fixed income. If the price of one ETH is lower\n                than 1100 at the moment of contract expiration, your ETH\n                transaction is valid, and you receive your ETH for 1100 plus the\n                fixed income.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                As in the first case, the further the required ETH buy price is\n                from the current market price, the lower the probability that\n                the transaction will occur. Consequently, \"limit order with\n                yield\" allows you to monetize not the transaction itself, but\n                the intent to buy ETH. At the same time, the transaction may not\n                take place, and you merely receive passive income in USDC.

If you agree to sell your asset at a certain price,\n                that means you would not earn more than that price + yield. By\n                setting a limit on your gains from price appreciation, the\n                market compensates you in exchange for this cap, allowing you to\n                earn a fixed yield.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <Styled.Card>\n                <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                  <span>EXAMPLE:</span> <br />\n                  Let's say the current price is 1400 and you agree to sell for\n                  1500 and wait for 7 days.

After the option\n                settlement date, the earned call/put premium is transferred back\n                to the client, minus fees (see Pic.1)\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <Styled.MobileImg\n                width={462}\n                height={274}\n                src={algorithmPic}\n                alt=\"algorithm\"\n              />\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                In product phase one (see paragraph 4), a simple Ethereum smart\n                contract is used to lock the funds until the expiration date and\n                process incoming and outgoing transfers.

These types of risks\n                are different for SELL-HIGH and BUY-LOW.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                <span>SELL-HIGH</span> <br />\n                As you are already holding ETH and are therefore exposed to its\n                price fluctuation risk, using TYMIO doesn't add any additional\n                risks. As described above in paragraph 5.1, at the contract\n                expiry date you will have one of two scenarios, which are\n                detailed at the signing of the contract. In case of selling ETH\n                at a higher price, you are limiting your upside, as the asset\n                price on the expiration date could be significantly higher than\n                the price of the executed limit order. Therefore, your profit\n                plus earned yield could be lower compared to the strategy of\n                just holding the asset until the expiration date. Nevertheless,\n                that would still be a better strategy than selling at the time\n                of contract initiation, as you will sell it at a higher price\n                plus earn additional yield.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <Styled.MobileImg\n                width={462}\n                height={274}\n                src={strategyPic}\n                alt=\"strategy\"\n              />\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                <span>BUY-LOW</span> <br />\n                In the case of using BUY-LOW, you are locking USDC to buy ETH\n                lower. At the time of the deal, you do not have exposure to ETH,\n                but if a transaction is executed, you will swap your USDC for\n                ETH at a certain price you set beforehand. At the time of\n                settlement, the price of ETH plus earned yield could be lower\n                than the price you set, resulting in an unrealized loss. As you\n                can see, BUY-LOW is riskier than SELL-HIGH when measuring risks\n                in USDC, so you should evaluate the contract text carefully and\n                execute a deal with TYMIO only if buying ETH at a certain price\n                level aligns with your long-term strategy. It's worth noting\n                that this outcome is still better than buying ETH at the market\n                price instead of using TYMIO BUY-LOW.\n              </UI.Paragraph>\n              <UI.Paragraph size={'large'}>\n                <span>SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITY RISK</span> <br />\n                Coding errors or bugs in smart contracts can lead to hacks,\n                exploits, or unintended consequences that can result in the loss\n                of funds.
